    [ ] Read in data properly and store for use
[ ] Narrow down variable to be displayed to user
[ ] Data structure of vars for each country with all inputs to model
    [ ] Tie into sidebar

[ ] Country Flays
    [ ] 23x15 pixels is the size required
    [ ] Display in sidebar
    [ ] Display under country name being displayed on screen
[ ] Zoom scale indicator somewhere so we can prove we can zoom to the appropriate level of 1 pixel per 10 km?
